Hello, this is the readme for my "Billiards - Style Carrom Game"
To run this game, you must simply run the python file entitled "temp.py"
You can do this either within a basic IDE like pyzo or another.
You can also run it from terminal with the python3 interpreter.
Make sure that temp.py and classPieces.py are within the same directory.
The following command in the terminal should work just fine:

python3 temp.py

No external libraries and or modules should be needed besides tkinter. 

The basic idea of the game is as follows. 
You can control a white striker piece and click in a certain direction to direct
it towards the 'Carrom Men' and/or a 'Queen'. Here, Carrom men are brown or black pieces that are each worth exactly one point. The queen is a red piece that is worth three points. You attempt to sink the pieces into pockets with the hopes of tallying more points than your opponent -- much like billiards. Indeed that was the intuition behind the game!

As you play, you shoot from wherever your opponent's piece ended up, and you get another turn if you make a point. 
There are two modes to play the game in. There is multiplayer and there is the AI, within which there are three levels: easy, medium, and hard. 

Have fun and I hope you enjoy the game!
